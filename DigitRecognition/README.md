## Recognize Hand-Written Digits 

### This is the first neural networks code that I wrote after reading Michael Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" tutorial. In order to have a thorough understanding of the derivation, this code does not use Pytorch or TensoFlow. The methods of Feed Forward, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Activation Function, etc. use python 3 with numpy. 

### The code runs on jupyter notebook. To run this code, it requires mnist_loader.py in python 3.

### As I gain more understanding of Deep Learning, I intend to try out different activation functions, cost functions and add regularization and other features to the code.
